# [HamSCI] Power Density Maps

This repository contains code to generate power density maps.

The `data` directory contains all the 3rd-party files used along with references
to where they were acquired. The `input` directory contains internal data that
is used to generate the output plots. The `output` directory is where the
resulting plots from the scripts are saved.
