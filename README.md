# [HamSCI] Power Density Maps

This repository contains code to generate power density maps. There are two main
scripts: `power_density_map.py` and `power_density_map_with_pop.py`. The first
script plots the power density without using population density to mask land
versus water. The second script does utilize masking in order to distinguish
from land and water.
